# Cloud Chain Storage (CCS â›“)

The decentralized  online storage that makes you to store encrypted data in nodes

- currently under development


This is been divided into three parts

* Node
* User (Client)
* Hosting API


# Node - 
It main intregal part of the network wehere all the nodes are conected to each other and provide their own storage to save the data of users in secure encrypted form, nodes will save the distributed data and with the hashes of all the distributions


# User or Client - 
It is the Graphical User Interafce(GUI) from where user will interact and use all the faeture that are provided to them

# Hosting API - 
It will act as intermediary between the user and nodes of the network to ensure that the node from which the are connected is valid or fake, just to improve the security of all the network. Bascially act as a problem resolver between client and nodes
